This repository contains the code for the grammar and bee experiment.
These experiments require YAP Prolog to run (available at http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/Yap/), we used YAP 6.3.4 in all experiments.

The input and output data are located in the subdirectory /results. Each pair input-k.pl/output-k.pl correspond to a run.

To rerun the experiments, go to the corresponding directory and call python run_experiment.

This work is based upon the Metagol system (Andrew Cropper and Stephen H. Muggleton, 2016, available at https://github.com/metagol/metagol) and the Metagol AI extension (Learning Higher-Order Logic Programs Through Abstraction and Invention, IJCAI 2016, Andrew Cropper and Stephen H. Muggleton)
